# HealingNeuro - A Depression Monitoring SystemðŸŒŸ

<br/>

## Overview  
The **Depression Monitoring System (DMS)** is a web-based application designed to assist **psychotherapists** in monitoring and predicting depression levels, promoting mental well-being in alignment with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being)**. By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, DMS provides an AI-driven approach to detecting depression and offering personalized recovery resources.

The system features **1-to-1 personalized video conferencing with mental health experts**, allowing real-time guidance and support. Additionally, it incorporates a **three-session weekly assessment** with diverse question formats to ensure comprehensive evaluation:

* **Session 1** â€“ Rating-based questions, trained on a dataset scaled up by 50% from survey responses.
* **Session 2** â€“ Scenario-based questions, utilizing insights from approximately 1,500 patient inputs.
* **Session 3** â€“ Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) for advanced textual analysis, enhancing interpretability.
With a predictive accuracy of 91%, the model effectively combines rating-based and textual data, offering reliable insights into users' mental health.

<br/>

## Objectives
* **Enhance Early Detection:** Develop a reliable self-assessment tool that identifies depressive symptoms promptly using structured questionnaires.
* **Facilitate Personalized Insights:** Generate tailored reports that provide users with a clear understanding of their mental health status.
* **Promote Continuous Monitoring :** Implement a system for weekly assessments and web extension to track changes in mental health over time and adjust recommendations accordingly.
* **Utilize Evidence-Based Methods:** Incorporate validated psychological assessments, including rating scales, scenario evaluations, and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) for comprehensive insights.

<br/>

## Key Features  
**1. Three-Part Assessment:**
* Rating Session: Users rate their feelings to measure depression severity.
* Scenario Session: Users respond to life situations to reveal emotional patterns.
* TAT Session: Users tell stories from images to uncover hidden thoughts.

**2. Personalized Reports:** 
Detailed feedback including

* Depression Stage: Mild, Moderate, or Severe.
* Depression Score: A number showing the current mental state.
* Insights: Analysis of language and thought patterns through graphical visualizations.

**3. Weekly Monitoring by professionals:**
Regular assessments and 1:1 video calls with professionals to track changes in mental health.
